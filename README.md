For this code, the only difference is that decreasing method sorts the data in decreasing order instead of keeping it in the way the scanner read it. So I just made a separate method that takes in data and a heuristic as string, and then does the same procedure of making a priority queue and printing out the statements. Differences that were made are in the code attached.
